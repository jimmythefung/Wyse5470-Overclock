Remove TDP limit to persist turboboost

# For Windows 11  
  * Copy the `RwPortableX64V1.7` folder to the `C Drive`.
  * Run the batch script `C:\RwPortableX64V1.7\tdp15.bat` to remove TDP.
  * (You can verify the CPU is running at turboboosted state via the task manager)

As a matter of convenience, create a windows task to run the `tdp15.bat` on system start up.
